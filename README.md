# PicArch
PicArch it helps you find images spread out across one or more locations (folders, services, etc), figure out where they all are, and helps collect and organize them where you want. 

PicArch is a specialized tool for a specific use case. Many of us started using digital photography in the early 2000s, before smart phones (or even camera phones), cloud storage, and non-professional photo management services were available. Over time as new clouds and services came online, and as we tried different smart phones and photo management services, our photos spread out far and wide. And it's a chore to track them all down and organize them

I thought it would be fun / useful to create a tool to help tame my photos. I made this tool for me, but anyone is welcome to use it if they want.

The name PicArch is short for Picture Archeologist.
